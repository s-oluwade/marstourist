- This was my first react project finished up to deployment. The website implements account registration, social media features, and a demo e-commerce store. You can add friends, make posts, and like other posts. There is even a separate admin section for managing user profiles and requests such as account deletion. 
- It was developed using React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, MongoDB, Express.js, and TypeScript.
